            The International League
        </h2>
        <p>
            Master Rogelio Giordano Magliacano officially founded the Pa-Kua International League in 1976. Master Magliacano began his study of Asian martial arts in 1952 and achieved various high degrees in many disciplines. Two decades of martial practice fully prepared him for the study of Pa-Kua with Master I Chan Ming in the Far East, who later named him his successor. Master Ming felt that among his disciples, Master Magliacano was the only one who truly understood the Pa-Kua knowledge in its entire spectrum.

        <h3>
            Regular Classes
        </h3>
        <p>
            Regular classes held on a weekly basis and are usually under the care of an Instructor or Master. These classes follow a curriculum based on a Belt system. Each practitioner is taught in a manner that foster care toward other practitioners in a non-competitive environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently there are nine Pa-Kua Disciplines: Martial Art, Edged Weapons, Sintony (Chinese Yoga), Cosmo Dynamics, Archery, Pa-Kua Rhythm, Reflexology, Pa-Kua Energy and Acrobatics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regular classes are usually held in small groups. They last approximately fifty minutes, preceded by five minutes to get set and introduce the class, and conclude with five minutes of answers to questions and announcements.

        </p>
        <p>
            Parents are invited to attend any of the classes their child is participating in, provided they do not distract them or interfere with their performance. Parents&rsquo; partnership and involvement in the Pa-Kua learning process is extremely important, hence we encourage parents to keep in touch with the Instructor responsible for their child as well as with the school&rsquo;s administrators. The Pa-Kua Association and the Responsible Masters are always available to receive comments and suggestions from parents.

            System and organization

        <h3>
            Evaluations
        </h3>
        <p>
            The International Pa-Kua League&rsquo;s educational system is based on the gradual progression of levels, closely monitored by several Masters. The ceremonial passage from one level to another (Belts) occurs through the Evaluation, which is unlike the Belt examinations found in other schools of Oriental knowledge. Before presenting him or her self to an Evaluation, the practitioner needs to fulfill certain requirements which include time of practice and study plan. But most importantly, he or she must undergo a personal development within the current belt.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure the Evaluation&rsquo;s fairness, it is leaded by a Master other than the one responsible for the student&rsquo;s education, which is usually an Itinerant Master. The Evaluator undergoes training to effectively lead an Evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The are eight Belts: White, Yellow, Orange, Green, Grey, Blue, Red, and Black. From White to Grey belts, Evaluations occur every two to four months with the student having attended at least sixteen general classes per Belt. The student can participate in any available Evaluation at any time. The cost of receiving the next Belt, regardless of how many Evaluations were attended, is defined by the International Pa-Kua League. From Grey belt onwards, level passage requires the student to participate in a Seminar in addition to attending regular classes.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Children&rsquo;s Evaluations
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Evaluation system for children differs slightly from the adult system. In order to move up Belt, children are evaluated in two age groups: 4 to 9 year old, and 10 to 14 year old.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the Evaluation they are assessed on their techniques, and also on their respectful behavior toward parents, instructors, and fellow students, both inside and outside the training facilities. A report is prepared before an Evaluation by the Instructor in charge, taking in consideration the progress and behavior of the student during general classes. At the Evaluation, the effort each child makes during the different activities and their progressive development of the techniques is taken into consideration. Helping children develop in general, gain self-confidence and enhance their general education is as important as their study of Martial Art techniques.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Pa-Kua Open Classes
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is the most important event of the Pa-Kua school worldwide, in which Pa-Kua practitioners &ndash; Masters, Instructors, students, their relatives, and guest &ndash; from all over the world, meet and share their experiences during a weekend in which all the Disciplines are practiced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pa-Kua practitioners from various parts of the world mount exhibitions demonstrating the various Pa-Kua Disciplines. The event culminates in a &ndash; usually &ndash; very large Martial Art class, punctuated by a Belt ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, there are three Open Classes every year: in North America, in Europe, and the International Gathering in South America.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main goal of the Open Classes is for the different members and students of the Pa-Kua school worldwide to get together, integrate, and socialise.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Itinerancies
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Pa-Kua International League monitors and regulates the manner and levels in which Pa-Kua is taught all over the world. This task is made possible by regular visits of Itinerant Masters to any part of the world where a representative of the Pa-Kua League is teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
            Itinerant Masters perform Evaluations and can also teach Special Classes, Regular Seminars, Courses and other activities to any student who desires to take the opportunity to further their Pa-Kua knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, Itinerant Masters have extensive life and teaching experience, have visited numerous places, speak more than one language, and have undergone special teaching training.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Uniforms, Accessories, etc.
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is of outmost importance that each student possesses a uniform and the accessories needed for training in a specific discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accessories can be purchased on the European Pa-Kua store online at pakuastore.com
        </p>
        <p>
            Belts obtained during an Evaluation will be supplied by the Pa-Kua International League and sent to practice location of each student. The process takes a few weeks in order for the Administration to check all the data and to mail it. When the Belts, Patches and/or certificates are received, they will be presented to the students in the various classes within the shortest delays.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Training of Instructors and Masters
        </h3>
        <p>
            Teaching is perhaps the most complex and gratifying experience that a human being can be involved in. At the Pa-Kua International League we are constantly on the look out for individuals willing to dedicate them self to teaching and diffusing the Pa-Kua knowledge. For that purpose, since 1976, Pa-Kua has established a complete Teaching System, which, through the years has constantly been updated. This system has allowed for the expansion of the Pa-Kua School in sixteen countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, there are two manners to achieve the level of Instructor, followed by the level of Master: either Regular Classes and Seminars, or Intensive Seminars. Training is adapted to the level of the student, according to the regulations issued by the Pa-Kua International League.
        </p>
        <p>
            Training accreditation have international validity, thus allowing Masters to teach all over the world.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Regular Seminars
        </h3>
        <p>
            After achieving the level of Grey Belt &ndash; usually after training during a period of eight to twelve months &ndash; a student of the Pa-Kua International League can start teaching Regular classes to White Belts. This allows the student to start building his own student base.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the beginning of his teaching career, the student will be under the supervision of his Master and of the Pa-Kua school. Progressively the student will develop the abilities to teach independently in a professional manner. Pa-Kua Instructors and Masters are all trained to lead groups of students, and acquire the tools to do so independently. The Superior Masters will constantly provide supervision and support.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Intensive Seminars
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Pa-Kua International League&rsquo;s Intensive Seminars are the right choice for those students who would like to deepen their knowledge. These seminars are designed for the modern man and woman, who work, study, and have little time for leisure activities, but nonetheless have and extreme curiosity and desire for personal growth and self-reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The curriculum of this type of Seminar comprises of techniques, philosophy and training, adapted to the student&rsquo;s physical and mental needs. What makes these seminars so successful is that they are tailored for each student allowing him or her to not only learn faster but also develop particular areas of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            At present, the Intensive Seminars are the most direct manner to access to the Pa-Kua knowledge, and the fastest and most effective way of learning. They are also a starting point to pursue a teaching track in a professional manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before an Intensive Seminar can begin, an email request has to be submitted to the Superior Masters.
