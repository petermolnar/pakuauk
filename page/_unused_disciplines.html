                    According to Reflexology's ancient Oriental philosophy there is an intrinsic relationship among all things, which is reflected in different levels. A small part of the body can influence the whole body, and vice versa. It can also serve as a map of its functioning. The study of those "micro-bodies" and their beneficial influences, in addition to other related exercises, are the basis of Reflexology classes in the Pa-Kua school.

                <p>
                    Through the study of traditional and comprehensive techniques, reflexology accelerates the body's own healing process, helping it to return to a natural state of balance. In addition, it preserves our vitality and keeps stress at healthy levels. Those benefits are obtained through manipulations of the "micro-bodies" such as the feet, hands and ears. Learning how to stimulate those body parts with massages, can promote healing or prevent organ imbalances.

                    In their constant search for answers, our ancestors realised that the key to understanding the Universe was self-study; achieving "Sintony" between themselves and the world around them. It is imperative, therefore, to work on harmonising our minds and body by practising movements and meditations that strengthen this connection. In the Pa-Kua School, this study is called Sintony, also known as Chinese Yoga; a path to self-knowledge through stretches, poses, breathing techniques, and meditation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sintony promotes excellent physical conditioning; movements tone and strengthen the body developing muscle mass while burning calories. Specifically, stretching exercises increase the students' flexibility, and help prevent injuries, whilst meditations oxygenate the body and regulate the cardiovascular system. The students will also learn techniques to relieve stress and achieve a state of tranquillity in their day-to day activities.

                    Music and dance have accompanied human beings since ancient times. Sounds and vibrations generate various mental and physical effects, and therefore, have a great influence on us. This power has been utilised for multiple purposes, ranging from entertainment to spirituality, meditation to, even, preparation for combat. That study is an important source of knowledge that helps overcome our physical limitations. In the Pa-Kua school this is exemplified by Pa-Kua Rhythm, a combination of music and martial art.
