                <h3>Martial Art</h3>
                <p>Learn kicks, punches, and self defence in a non-competitive, inclusive environment</p>
                <details> <summary>More</summary>
                    <p>Through the study of Pa-Kua Martial Art, students will develop their physical strength, while learning unique techniques employing pressure points, levers, throws, and more. Pa-Kua fosters the students’ better understanding of them-selves and of their surroundings. This is facilitated by the non-competitive manner of teaching, whereby students challenges only themselves and their personal abilities.</p>
                    <p>On and off the mat, every student will face his or her own limitations and fears, having to strive toward overcoming them without any comparison to other students. This philosophy allows students of all ages and background to practice Pa-Kua Martial Art.</p>
                    <p>The technical aspect of Pa-Kua Martial Art includes circular movements and the use of the opponent’s strength against him or herself. A strong emphasis is placed on physical and mental balance, expressed through movements that are – according to the needs of a particular situation – both fluid and rigid, strong and slow. Each of the Eight Belt levels feature different aspects of Martial Art. When a Pa-Kua practitioner reaches the level of Black Belt, he or she is a complete warrior, confident in his or her abilities and of him or herself.</p>

                <p>Overcome your fears while having fun and building core strength</p>
                <details> <summary>More</summary>
                    <p>Evidence of acrobatics exercises being practiced in China date prior to the Western Han Dynasty, 2500 years ago. During the Tang Dynasty, for example, acrobatics were part of the village harvest festivals. Nowadays, defying the laws of gravity continues to be an important part of the modern Chinese culture.</p>
                    <p>Pa-Kua Acrobatics is a class that develops your core strength, flexibility, and balance, working various muscle groups which are vital to the practice of postures and routines. A strong self-awareness develops and an acute mind/body connection occurs. Everything is taught according to the student’s abilities, who slowly acquires the necessary strength and skills needed before progressing to the next level of training. When the student feels prepared, and by overcoming fears and doubts, he or she will gradually learn how to do handstands, cartwheels, one-handed cartwheels, one-handed handstands, butterflies, bridges, front walkovers, back walkovers, front handsprings, back handsprings, front flips, back flips, and much more. It is a fun activity for friends to work together, training elaborate balance movements that require support and cooperation.</p>

                    <p>The use of sharp edged weapons is an intrinsic part of human evolution and its struggle for survival. It has generated a fascination that has remained with us in modern times. In the Orient, following the „Way of the Sword“ not only gave an individual status, but also offered an existence of increased self-discipline and control. It also gave the individual an understanding of life, resulting from the daily interactions with dangerous situations. <br> <br> An integral part of the Pa-Kua knowledge, the study of Traditional Ancient Chinese Weapons is a way of developing the individual’s Inner Warrior, developing inner strength while physically strengthening the body. Discipline, self-confidence and courage are just some of the many benefits derived from studying combat with edged weapons. <br> <br> Working with swords enhances precision, depth perception, and coordination. Studying the way of the ancient warrior remains essential for us today. Through this study we develop faster reflexes and courage to overcome our day-to-day battles, thus facing the world as leaders who can overcome difficulties with strength and determination. <br> <br> <strong> Benefits of the practice </strong></p>

                <h3>Oriental Archery</h3>
                <p>Learn to focus, relax, and find the perfect shot</p>
                <details> <summary>More</summary>
                    <p>Throughout the centuries wise men have looked for the deep meaning of our day-to-day life practices in order to have a better contact with ourselves: calligraphy, martial arts, the tea ceremony, the theater… and archery was not the exception.</p>
                    <p>Many factors compose the “perfect shot” and they are mostly mental. The delicate equilibrium needed to release that shot, leads to achieving higher mental states. Many ancient Oriental philosophers devoted themselves to archery in search for those higher states of consciousness, known by many as illumination. That fostered a development of Chinese Archery which has maintained, through the ages, it’s simplicity and beauty.</p>
                    <p>Breathing is also fundamental to the process. When it is kept stable and synchronized with the movements, the execution of the shot becomes easy and natural. The various shooting positions help develop a better understanding of the body, and gives the mind a better capacity for adapting to surrounding changes. That is the base of an extremely functional shooting style.</p>
                    <p><strong> Benefits of the practice: </strong></p>

                <details> <summary>More</summary>
                    <p>For millions of years, man has observed the heavens and seasonal changes, looking for a better understanding of the world that surrounds us. Based on our observations, we adapted our living cycles to that of nature, learning to live in harmony with the forces of nature. However, with the advent of technology, men have somewhat lost this relationship, which has resulted in an imbalance in our lives and also in the environment.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore essential for us to return to the ancient knowledge of CosmoDynamics, also known as Pa-Kua Tai Chi, where students learn to live in sync with the Universe, as well as improve their inner strength and balance. The study incorporates slow and fluid movements which are used to relax and develop complete body control. With continued practice, the student will also learn self-defence techniques.</p>
                    <p>Benefits of the practice:</p>
                    <ul>

                <details> <summary>More</summary>
                    <p>According to Reflexology's ancient Oriental philosophy there is an intrinsic relationship among all things, which is reflected in different levels. A small part of the body can influence the whole body, and vice versa. It can also serve as a map of its functioning. The study of those "micro-bodies" and their beneficial influences, in addition to other related exercises, are the basis of Reflexology classes in the Pa-Kua school.</p>
                    <p>Through the study of traditional and comprehensive techniques, reflexology accelerates the body's own healing process, helping it to return to a natural state of balance. In addition, it preserves our vitality and keeps stress at healthy levels. Those benefits are obtained through manipulations of the "micro-bodies" such as the feet, hands and ears. Learning how to stimulate those body parts with massages, can promote healing or prevent organ imbalances.</p>
                    <p>Benefits of the practice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strengthens the body's immune system</li>

                <details> <summary>More</summary>
                    <p>In their constant search for answers, our ancestors realised that the key to understanding the Universe was self-study; achieving "Sintony" between themselves and the world around them. It is imperative, therefore, to work on harmonising our minds and body by practising movements and meditations that strengthen this connection. In the Pa-Kua School, this study is called Sintony, also known as Chinese Yoga; a path to self-knowledge through stretches, poses, breathing techniques, and meditation.</p>
                    <p>Sintony promotes excellent physical conditioning; movements tone and strengthen the body developing muscle mass while burning calories. Specifically, stretching exercises increase the students' flexibility, and help prevent injuries, whilst meditations oxygenate the body and regulate the cardiovascular system. The students will also learn techniques to relieve stress and achieve a state of tranquillity in their day-to day activities.</p>
                    <p>Benefits of the practice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Controls stress</li>

                    <p>Music and dance have accompanied human beings since ancient times.
