            <h3>Martial Art</h3>
            <p>Learn kicks, punches, and self defence in a non-competitive, inclusive environment</p>
            <details> <summary>More</summary>
                <p>Through the study of Pa-Kua Martial Art, students will develop their physical strength, while learning unique techniques employing pressure points, levers, throws, and more. Pa-Kua fosters the students’ better understanding of them-selves and of their surroundings. This is facilitated by the non-competitive manner of teaching, whereby students challenges only themselves and their personal abilities.</p>
                <p>On and off the mat, every student will face his or her own limitations and fears, having to strive toward overcoming them without any comparison to other students. This philosophy allows students of all ages and background to practice Pa-Kua Martial Art.</p>
                <p>The technical aspect of Pa-Kua Martial Art includes circular movements and the use of the opponent’s strength against him or herself. A strong emphasis is placed on physical and mental balance, expressed through movements that are – according to the needs of a particular situation – both fluid and rigid, strong and slow. Each of the Eight Belt levels feature different aspects of Martial Art. When a Pa-Kua practitioner reaches the level of Black Belt, he or she is a complete warrior, confident in his or her abilities and of him or herself.</p>

            <p>Overcome your fears while having fun and building core strength</p>
            <details> <summary>More</summary>
                <p>Evidence of acrobatics exercises being practiced in China date prior to the Western Han Dynasty, 2500 years ago.

Everything is taught according to the student’s abilities, who slowly acquires the necessary strength and skills needed before progressing to the next level of training. When the student feels prepared, and by overcoming fears and doubts, he or she will gradually learn how to do handstands, cartwheels, one-handed cartwheels, one-handed handstands, butterflies, bridges, front walkovers, back walkovers, front handsprings, back handsprings, front flips, back flips, and much more. It is a fun activity for friends to work together, training elaborate balance movements that require support and cooperation.</p>

Studying the way of the ancient warrior remains essential for us today. Through this study we develop faster reflexes and courage to overcome our day-to-day battles, thus facing the world as leaders who can overcome difficulties with strength and determination. <br> <br> <strong> Benefits of the practice </strong></p>

            <h3>Oriental Archery</h3>
            <p>Learn to focus, relax, and find the perfect shot</p>
            <details> <summary>More</summary>
                <p>Throughout the centuries wise men have looked for the deep meaning of our day-to-day life practices in order to have a better contact with ourselves: calligraphy, martial arts, the tea ceremony, the theater… and archery was not the exception.</p>
                <p>Many factors compose the “perfect shot” and they are mostly mental. The delicate equilibrium needed to release that shot, leads to achieving higher mental states. Many ancient Oriental philosophers devoted themselves to archery in search for those higher states of consciousness, known by many as illumination. That fostered a development of Chinese Archery which has maintained, through the ages, it’s simplicity and beauty.</p>
                <p>Breathing is also fundamental to the process. When it is kept stable and synchronized with the movements, the execution of the shot becomes easy and natural. The various shooting positions help develop a better understanding of the body, and gives the mind a better capacity for adapting to surrounding changes. That is the base of an extremely functional shooting style.</p>
                <p><strong> Benefits of the practice: </strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improves concentration</li>
                    <li>Better physical and mental equilibrium</li>
                    <li>Improvement in body posture</li>
